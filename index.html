<p>
  I am 17 year old boy who came from <a href="https://bit.ly/2MJ0SL4">Incheon</a>, in South Korea. 
  I am currently living in US, in Seattle, Washington. I've been
  living in US since, 2010. My father sent me and my brother first to United States because he didnt have enought money for himself.
  After a year, my father came. I lived with my grandparents and my dad's brother.
  Life was difficult for me in the beginning because I didn't know any English. 
  I couldn't speak any English language. I first started learning basic steps like alphabets.
  Memorizing was hard at first of course, but it got easier when I got used to it. 
  I remember going elementary school and being scared. It was the most scary experience that I encountered.
  It was like getting lost in a mall because I was by myself and I couldn't speak English. 
  Although this event has let me down but it also helped me to shape. It gave me a motive to learn English. 
  At first I tried to study English because I had to live in US but my reason changed to I need to learn English 
  so I dont get ashamed with class mates and interact with them. During my over 9 years, I studied English and Mathematics
  and was able to finish Elementary, Middle school and right here in Lynnwood High school. 
  However, Highschool life was more harsh than the time when I started learning English.
  I had to take care of my GPA and I had to study for the SAT but i knew that all of these make a pathway of my life. 
 I’m sometimes jealous of students who do nothing because during my middle school and up to high school all I’ve been doing was SAT and maintaining my GPA. 
 My family and my church teachers hope that I will go to the University of Washington. 
 I had to prepare the steps for high school because, in high school, GPA and SAT matter the most. 
 When I watched my friends getting good grades I got 2 opposite feelings. 
 One is that it gives a feeling of motivation and second it gives a feeling of hopeless if I don’t get grades that I wish.
 Comparing freshmen and sophomore’s GPA, I improved yet Junior year worries me. 
 Some of the assignments stress me, it’s like drinking a liquid medicine to get better. 
 I just wished that if I wake up tomorrow my high school life would be over but not a chance.
 But I learned that when stress comes, I just got to ignore, look forward and believe in my abilities.
 If I think easy, then it becomes easy. Currently, My future plan is just going to Universities and finshing and just go wtih the flow.
 This is My story and my piece of memory. 
 For me, I think that memories is something that each self need to keep because 
 memories become your lessons and lessons becomes your memories.
