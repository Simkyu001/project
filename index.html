             I am 17 year old boy who came from Incheon, in South Korea. 
             I am currently living in US, in Seattle, Washington. I've 
             been living in US since, 2010. Life was difficult for me in 
             the beginning because I didn't know any English. I couldn't
             speach any English language. I first started learning basic
             steps like alphabets.
