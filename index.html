My story.

<p>
  I am 17 year old boy who came from <a href="https://bit.ly/2MJ0SL4">Incheon</a>, in South Korea. 
  I am currently living in US, in Seattle, Washington. I've been
  living in US since, 2010. Life was difficult for me in the beginning because I didn't know any English. 
  I couldn't speak any English language. I first started learning basic steps like alphabets.
  Memorizing was hard at first of course, but it got easier when I got used to it.
