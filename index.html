<p>
  I am 17 year old boy who came from <a href="https://bit.ly/2MJ0SL4">Incheon</a>, in South Korea. 
  I am currently living in US, in Seattle, Washington. I've been
  living in US since, 2010. My father sent me and my brother first to United States because he didnt have enought money for himself.
  After a year, my father came. I lived with my grandparents and my dad's brother.
  Life was difficult for me in the beginning because I didn't know any English. 
  I couldn't speak any English language. I first started learning basic steps like alphabets.
  Memorizing was hard at first of course, but it got easier when I got used to it. 
  I remember going elementary school and being scared. It was the most scary experience that I encountered.
  It was like getting lost in a mall because I was by myself and I couldn't speak English. 
  Although this event has let me down but it also helped me to shape. It gave me a motive to learn English. 
  At first I tried to study English because I had to live in US but my reason changed to I need to learn English 
  so I dont get ashamed with class mates and interact with them. During my over 9 years, I studied English and Mathematics
  and was able to finish Elementary, Middle school and right here in Lynnwood High school. 
  However, Highschool life was more harsh than the time when I started learning English.
  I had to take care of my GPA and I had to study for the SAT.
