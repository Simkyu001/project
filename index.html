<p>
  I am 17 year old boy who came from <a href="https://bit.ly/2MJ0SL4">Incheon</a>, in South Korea. 
  I am currently living in US, in Seattle, Washington. I've been
  living in US since, 2010. My father sent me and my brother first to United States because he didnt have enought money for himself.
  After a year, my father came. I lived with my grandparents and my dad's brother.
  Life was difficult for me in the beginning because I didn't know any English. 
  I couldn't speak any English language. I first started learning basic steps like alphabets.
  Memorizing was hard at first of course, but it got easier when I got used to it. 
  I remember going elementary school and being scared. It was scaredist experience that I experienced.
  It was like getting lost in a mall because I was by myself and I couldn't speak English.
